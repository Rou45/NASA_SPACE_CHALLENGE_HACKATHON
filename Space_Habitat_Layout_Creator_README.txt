# 🛰️ Your Home in Space – The Habitat Layout Creator

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Habitat Layout Creator** is a visual and interactive design tool for creating and assessing **space habitat layouts**. Inspired by NASA’s Artemis campaign and Moon-to-Mars exploration goals, this tool allows users to define the **shape, size, and internal layout** of space habitats and experiment with different mission scenarios.

The project enables **students, researchers, and professionals** to quickly design habitats while considering critical constraints like **crew size, mission duration, payload fairing limits, and environmental conditions**.

This project directly addresses NASA’s challenge:
> “Space habitats are ‘homes in space’ that must keep crew members healthy, safe, and capable of executing missions.”

## 🌌 Core Objectives
1. Define habitat geometry – Select shapes (cylindrical, spherical, modular, inflatable, surface-built) and set dimensions.
2. Partition volume – Allocate areas for critical functions (life support, food prep, hygiene, sleep, exercise, medical, stowage).
3. Check constraints – Automatically validate if the defined layout satisfies crew size, mission duration, and NASA volume requirements.
4. Iterate and experiment – Try out multiple designs, resize areas, create multilevel layouts, or arrange radially around a core.
5. Visualize interactively – Drag & drop functional areas, move objects (beds, exercise machines, plant modules), and view 2D/3D layouts.
6. Get quantitative feedback – Floor area, usable volume, access paths, adjacency zoning recommendations.
7. Share & compare – Export and share habitat designs with other users.

## 🧑‍🚀 Key Features
- Habitat Shape Library (cylindrical, spherical, dome, inflatable, modular).
- Crew & Mission Setup (crew size, mission duration, destination).
- Drag-and-Drop Layout Builder.
- Rule Engine – automatic checks against NASA standards.
- 2D & 3D Visualization with Three.js/WebGL.
- Quantitative Outputs: net habitable volume, adjacency, floor area.
- Design Sharing – export and community mode.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Three.js/Babylon.js, TailwindCSS.
- **Backend**: FastAPI or Node.js/Express (optional).
- **Storage**: MongoDB/Postgres/Firebase (optional).
- **Rule Engine**: Python module for NASA standards.
- **APIs**: NASA data, 3D model libraries, optional AI optimization.

## ⚙️ Functional Workflow
1. User defines habitat shape & size.
2. Sets mission parameters (crew, duration, destination).
3. Drag & drop modules into 2D/3D editor.
4. System checks constraints & gives feedback.
5. Iterate and refine layout.
6. Export/save design.

## 📊 Quantitative Outputs
- Net Habitable Volume (NHV) per astronaut.
- Total floor space and area allocation per module.
- Adjacency map and access path validation.

## 🎯 Target Users
- Students, researchers, educators, engineers, space enthusiasts.

## 🛑 Constraints
- Launch vehicle payload fairing.
- Destination environment (microgravity, lunar surface, Martian surface).
- Crew size and mission duration.
